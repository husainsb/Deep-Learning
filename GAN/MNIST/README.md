# Deep Convolutional GAN on MNIST handwritten digits

I have implemented DCGAN from scratch using Keras and Tensorflow as a backend.
GANs consist of 2 deep neural networks, generator and discriminator that works togather to achieve the task of generating image
which is indistinguishable from real image. It's minimax zero-sum game.
Nash equilibrium is achieved when discriminator can no longer distinguish real image from the fake image generated by Generator.
Hence loss for discriminator will be 0.5.

Since both networks simultaneously learns the weights, it takes longer to achieve the convergence in GAN.

You need to experiment with different hyper-parameters to achieve images closer to reality.
